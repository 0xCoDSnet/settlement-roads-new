# Countered's Settlement Roads

Countered's Settlement Roads is a Minecraft mod that generates **roads between villages** to create a more connected and immersive world.

### Features
- Automatically detects villages and places roads between them
- Natural and Artificial style roads
- Decorations along the way!

### Status
The project is in an early but working state. Terrain generation and pathfinding still have room for improvement, lag needs to be reduced â€” contributions are very welcome!

### Contributing
Want to help improve road layout, generation rules, or terrain adaptation? Contributions of any kind are appreciated. Just open a PR or issue!
